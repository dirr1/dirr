# PolyTerm Premium Roadmap

> A strategic plan to transform PolyTerm into a must-have tool for serious Polymarket traders, targeting 20-30% conversion to paid subscriptions.

---

## Executive Summary

Polymarket has exploded to **$14B+ monthly volume** with an $8B valuation. This creates massive demand for tools that provide trading edge. Current competitors charge $10-50/month for analytics, yet most focus on web dashboards—leaving a gap for a **powerful terminal-based tool** that appeals to serious traders who live in the command line.

**PolyTerm's Unique Position:**
- Terminal-native (appeals to quants, developers, power users)
- Real-time WebSocket integration already built
- Strong foundation with Gamma/CLOB API integration
- Differentiated UX from browser-based competitors

**Target Users:**
1. Algorithmic traders building Polymarket strategies
2. Crypto-native power users comfortable with CLI
3. Developers integrating prediction market data
4. Quants seeking alpha in prediction markets

---

## Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Free Tier Improvements)

**Goal:** Make the free tier genuinely useful to build user base.

#### 1.1 Enhanced Whale Detection (Priority: Critical)
**Problem:** Current whale detection only shows volume aggregates, not individual trades.

**Solution:**
- Use CLOB WebSocket `maker_address` field to track individual large traders
- Build wallet reputation database (local SQLite)
- Track win rates, avg position size, market preferences per wallet
- Identify "smart money" vs "dumb money" wallets

**Technical Approach:**
```
WebSocket trade → Extract maker_address → Store in local DB
                                        → Calculate wallet metrics
                                        → Flag wallets with >70% win rate as "smart money"
```

#### 1.2 Persistent Local Database
**Problem:** All data lost on restart, no historical context.

**Solution:**
- SQLite database for local storage
- Store: wallet profiles, trade history, market snapshots, alerts
- Enable offline analysis of historical patterns
- Path: `~/.polyterm/data.db`

#### 1.3 Improved Alert System
**Problem:** Current alerts are terminal-only, easy to miss.

**Solution:**
- Telegram bot integration (self-hosted)
- Discord webhook support
- macOS/Linux native notifications (already partial)
- Email alerts via SMTP config
- Sound alerts with customizable tones

---

### Phase 2: Premium Detection Features (Paid Tier)

**Goal:** Provide genuine alpha that justifies subscription.

#### 2.1 Insider Trading Detection Engine
**Problem:** High-profile insider cases ($400K Venezuela bet) show detection is valuable.

**Justification:** PolyTrack charges $9.99/week ($40/mo) for this single feature.

**Detection Signals:**
1. **Fresh wallet + large bet** - New wallet with immediate $10k+ position
2. **Pre-event volume spike** - Unusual activity before news breaks
3. **Perfect timing correlation** - Trades immediately before announcements
4. **Wallet cluster analysis** - Multiple wallets with correlated behavior
5. **Win rate anomaly** - >90% win rate across multiple markets

**Severity Scoring System:**
```
Score 0-100 based on:
- Wallet age (newer = higher risk)       [0-25 points]
- Position size relative to avg          [0-25 points]
- Timing before known events             [0-25 points]
- Win rate deviation from expected       [0-25 points]

High Risk: 70+
Medium Risk: 40-69
Low Risk: 0-39
```

**Implementation:**
- Real-time monitoring via WebSocket
- Local database of wallet profiles
- Pattern matching against historical insider cases
- Configurable alert thresholds

#### 2.2 Smart Money Tracking
**Problem:** Users want to follow successful traders.

**Features:**
- Leaderboard of top wallets by ROI
- Real-time alerts when tracked wallets trade
- Position mirroring suggestions
- Wallet tagging (insider suspect, whale, market maker, etc.)

**Data Source:** CLOB WebSocket + historical aggregation

#### 2.3 Cross-Market Arbitrage Scanner
**Problem:** Manual arbitrage checking is slow; opportunities close in seconds.

**Features:**
- Scan correlated markets for price discrepancies
- Detect YES+NO < $1.00 opportunities within Polymarket
- Alert on spreads > 2.5% (profitable after fees)
- Show expected profit after fees

**Implementation:**
```
For each market pair (M1, M2) where M1 ≈ M2:
  If M1.YES_ask + M2.NO_ask < 0.975:  # 2.5% spread minimum
    Alert: "Arbitrage: Buy M1 YES + M2 NO = ${spread}% profit"
```

#### 2.4 Order Book Intelligence
**Problem:** Current spread calculation is basic; no depth analysis.

**Features:**
- Visualize bid/ask depth (ASCII chart in terminal)
- Detect large hidden orders (icebergs)
- Identify support/resistance levels from order clustering
- Slippage calculator for large orders
- Liquidity imbalance alerts (potential manipulation)

**Data Source:** CLOB `/book` endpoint (already available)

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Premium+)

**Goal:** Enterprise-grade features for serious traders.

#### 3.1 Kalshi Integration
**Problem:** Cross-platform arbitrage is the biggest alpha opportunity.

**Features:**
- Unified market view (Polymarket + Kalshi)
- Real-time arbitrage alerts between platforms
- Fee-adjusted profit calculations
- Automated market matching (similar events)

**Justification:** Traders made $40M in arbitrage last year.

**Technical Challenge:**
- Kalshi API integration (new client needed)
- Market matching algorithm (NLP for event similarity)
- Fee structure differences (Kalshi ~0.7%, PM varies)

#### 3.2 AI-Powered Predictions
**Problem:** Current prediction is basic momentum-only.

**Features:**
- Multi-factor signal generation
- News sentiment integration (via API)
- Volume pattern recognition
- Whale behavior signals
- Confidence scoring with historical accuracy tracking

**Model Inputs:**
1. Price momentum (existing)
2. Volume acceleration
3. Whale position changes
4. Related market movements
5. Time to resolution
6. News sentiment score

#### 3.3 Portfolio Analytics (Rebuild)
**Problem:** Subgraph deprecation broke portfolio tracking.

**Solution:** Direct on-chain data via Polygon RPC.

**Features:**
- Multi-wallet tracking
- Historical P&L charts (ASCII in terminal)
- Risk exposure analysis
- Position concentration warnings
- Performance vs. benchmark (market average)

**Technical Approach:**
- Use Polygon RPC to read contract state
- Or: Bitquery API (indexed Polygon data)
- Cache positions locally in SQLite

#### 3.4 Market Correlation Engine
**Problem:** Placeholder implementation never completed.

**Features:**
- Calculate rolling correlations between markets
- Alert on correlation breaks (potential opportunity)
- Cluster analysis of related markets
- Category-based correlation heatmaps

---

### Phase 4: Power User Features

#### 4.1 Scriptable Interface / SDK
**Problem:** Power users want to automate.

**Features:**
- JSON output mode for all commands
- Python SDK for programmatic access
- Webhook API for external integrations
- Custom alert scripting

**Example:**
```bash
# Get markets as JSON for scripting
polyterm monitor --format json | jq '.[] | select(.probability > 0.9)'

# Webhook on whale activity
polyterm watch --webhook https://my-server.com/alerts
```

#### 4.2 Historical Data API
**Problem:** Historical data for backtesting is hard to get.

**Features:**
- Download historical trade data
- OHLCV data by market
- Exportable for ML training
- Configurable time ranges

#### 4.3 Custom Dashboard Builder
**Problem:** Users want personalized views.

**Features:**
- Define custom TUI layouts
- Save/load dashboard configs
- Multiple simultaneous market views
- Split-pane terminal interface
