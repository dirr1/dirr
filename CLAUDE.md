# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PolyTerm is a terminal-based monitoring and analytics tool for PolyMarket prediction markets. It provides both a CLI and an interactive TUI (Terminal User Interface) for tracking markets, whale activity, insider patterns, arbitrage opportunities, and AI-powered predictions.

## Common Commands

### Development Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest                                                    # Full test suite
pytest tests/test_cli/test_cli.py -v                      # Specific test file
pytest tests/test_cli/test_cli.py::TestCLI::test_cli_version -v  # Specific test
pytest tests/test_live_data/ -v                           # Live API integration tests (may fail due to data changes)
```

### Building & Publishing
```bash
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

## Architecture

### Entry Points
- **CLI**: `polyterm/cli/main.py` - Click-based CLI, launches TUI if no subcommand
- **TUI**: `polyterm/tui/controller.py` - Main TUI loop with `TUIController` class

### Key Patterns

**API Fallback**: `APIAggregator` tries Gamma API first, falls back to CLOB if needed.

**TUI Flow**: User selection → `TUIController` routes to screen → Screen gathers input → Launches CLI command via subprocess.

**Config**: TOML-based at `~/.polyterm/config.toml`, `Config` class uses dot notation (e.g., `config.get("alerts.probability_threshold")`).

**WebSocket**: Live monitor uses RTDS WebSocket at `wss://ws-live-data.polymarket.com` with polling fallback.

**Database**: SQLite via `Database` class. All operations use context managers for connection handling.

**JSON Output**: All CLI commands support `--format json` via utilities in `polyterm/utils/json_output.py`.

### TUI Menu Options

```

## Testing Notes

- Tests use `responses` library for HTTP mocking
- Live data tests (`tests/test_live_data/`) hit real APIs - may fail due to data changes
- Config tests should use `tmp_path` fixture to avoid polluting user config
- When mocking `Console`, also mock `console.size.width` for responsive menu tests
- CLI compatibility tests in `tests/test_tui/test_cli_compatibility.py` verify TUI screens use valid CLI options
- Database tests create temp databases via `tmp_path` fixture

## Version Management

Version is defined in TWO places (keep in sync):
- `polyterm/__init__.py` - `__version__ = "x.y.z"`
- `setup.py` - `version="x.y.z"`

## Key Implementation Details

**Rich Colors**: Use standard colors like `bright_magenta`, `cyan`, `yellow` - avoid extended colors like `medium_purple1` for terminal compatibility.

**TUI Screens**: Most screens invoke CLI commands via subprocess. Exception: `analytics.py` trending markets displays directly using Rich tables (uses `aggregator.get_top_markets_by_volume()` directly).

**Insider Detection Scoring** (`core/whale_tracker.py`):
- Wallet age (newer = riskier): 0-25 points
- Position size relative to avg: 0-25 points
- Win rate anomaly: 0-25 points
- Trading pattern (few trades, high stakes): 0-25 points
- Risk levels: High (70+), Medium (40-69), Low (0-39)

**Arbitrage Detection** (`core/arbitrage.py`):
- Intra-market: YES + NO < $0.975 (2.5% spread minimum)
- Correlated: Title similarity + price divergence

**Prediction Signals** (`core/predictions.py`):
